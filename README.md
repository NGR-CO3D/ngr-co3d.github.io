# NGR-CO3D Workshop
Website for ECCV 2022 [Neural Geometry and Rendering: Advances and the Common Objects in 3D Challenge](https://ngr-co3d.github.io).

<summary>Build Notes</summary>
The website is built using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, which is a Ruby Gem.
To build it locally, you will need to install Ruby and Jekyll following the instructions <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/">here</a>.

After installing Jekyll, simply run `jekyll build` to build the webpage.

*Note*: On M1 Mac (Monterey), it somehow fails to build with Ruby-3.1.1 but works with Ruby-2.7.5.
